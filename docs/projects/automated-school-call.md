# Automated School Call

## Summary

Using neural networks to identify faces, the idea of the project is to a software manage presence of the students on classes.

## Introduction

The idea came from a talk on a with a professor of Insper, which he showed irritancy for having to worry about student call every class. So we got utilized our visual computation subject to develop a solution for this irratation.

## Solution

We developed a software using neural networks that were able to identify people consistently and mark their time of identification. Using this data, we can define classes Deltatime and see if the student were identified between the window of time.

## Development

It's was developed with the agile method gathering up twice a week to discuss development and next steps, it took about 4 months of development, and we stopped due to ending the subject and the presentation of a functioning MVP.
