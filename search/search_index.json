Introduction The idea came from a talk on a with a professor of Insper, which he showed irritancy for having to worry about student call every class. So we got utilized our visual computation subject to develop a solution for this irratation. Solution We developed a software using neural networks that were able to identify people consistently and mark their time of identification. Using this data, we can define classes Deltatime and see if the student were identified between the window of time. Development It's was developed with the agile method gathering up twice a week to discuss development and next steps, it took about 4 months of development, and we stopped due to ending the subject and the presentation of a functioning MVP.","title":"Automated School Call"},{"location":"projects/automated-school-call/#automated-school-call","text":"","title":"Automated School Call"},{"location":"projects/automated-school-call/#summary","text":"Using neural networks to identify faces, the idea of the project is to a software manage presence of the students on classes.","title":"Summary"},{"location":"projects/automated-school-call/#introduction","text":"The idea came from a talk on a with a professor of Insper, which he showed irritancy for having to worry about student call every class.

We develop this with computer vision, and developed it to be able to became a service on the cloud as an API. Introduction The project was developed in pair with Dell Technologies team, the idea came from inside their office, one of their clients had requested something of this kind. With their support on Project Management and Professional do aid us on technical doubts.
